# A Buggy Mission Unfolding

**Knowing that I once had a mission and then a different mission that was killed by this new mission that I have to work on along with my old-new friends was really too much to take in.**

I simply hated starting something that I won't finish. I must complete these three missions though the order of completion is now reversed by **She** and whoever it is to got us in here in the first place. The moment I come in contact with this individual or the group, I must avenged my personal assistant's death...

_"Relax **BB**"_, **She** interrupted my thoughts.

I was panting heavily from anger; the result of such thoughts. I hated the fact that someone who was really by my side, that had fought thousands of battles with me, was dead, killed by these **animals** that got us here. She was a woman that I really respected, a widow whose two children and husband was killed in a fire accident caused by these same creatures.

_Does that mean they won us? Their satisfaction and victory is going to be temporary. I will make sure they regret ever stepping on our toes._

I was really angry, and this exposed my thoughts to **She**, and also informed her that my memories were back.

_"Why didn't you tell me?"_, **She** asked me, a hurt expression on her face.

I was surprised at how she got hurt easily over very trivial matters. I thought she has a very strong heart that isn't buzzed by little things.

_I am very emotional **BB** because of my abilities_, she spoke into my mind, _And it is very easy for you to hurt me than anyone else since I like you so much._

I was shocked by her statement. _Is she flattering me?! She doesn't stop amazing me with how unpredictable her actions, words, and thoughts (which I can't read) are._

_I am serious **BB**, I knew what you wanted to say when you said 'never mind' back there, and I was happy that your feelings for me are the same as mine for you. That was why I sniggered from the thrill._

She was expressing her feelings to me? I knew she was totally honest, and I felt honoured, at first, to be fed with such information by her. My past self suddenly kicked in, that part of me that was defensive to relationships like this. I started laughing, trying to mock her, but it was the least convincing. I felt stupid when others started looking at me confused, since they could not hear the conversation going on between **She** and me.

**She** spoke out: _"I have deep feelings for **BB** and I told him, that was why he was laughing."_

I became embarrassed, very embarrassed. I didn't expect **She** to mention that. Why is she always doing what I least expect?

_"He won't pay you any attention!"_, **Vanessa** said gravely, but softly with a gentle smile, _"We have tried to get his attention in past. Even if I didn't spoke up, Wendy did, but a futile effort it was."_

_"In my case, I know he loves me. his mind says so, his body says the same, and his feelings expose the same, but he is trying to resist it. Please **BB**, accept my proposal. Why do any lady that comes in contact with you become very attached to you?"_, **She** said, and tears flooded her cheeks.

I became dumbfounded, very confused, and felt irritated by her childish display. I guess she is just acting after all...but she doesn't lie and that scares me.

I subconsciously reach out to her and grabbed her by the hands, pulled her a bit closer, and wiped her tears carefully. I then let go of her and stepped some feet backwards, a bit shaky.

_"I won't accept your proposal, this is too childish and you should have waited till I did propose. Your childishness irritates me. I believe you are more mature than this."_

_"I am sorry **BB**, but I haven't felt this way before..._", She said still sobbing.

_"When you encounter a feeling that you haven't felt before, you ought to test that the feeling is valid for sometimes before you give in to that feeling."_, I responded sharply.

She looked at me with a frown, then a beautiful smile lit her face. She turned around towards others and laughed mischievously, so loud and so hard that tears rolled down her cheeks.

*"This has proved that his past memories are back. He doesn't want to inform us, but I have confirmed he has. Remember, the **BB** you once know is so relationship-sensitive that he believes it is a fault to be in love. If he hadn't regain these memories, he would easily agree to his feelings."*, She revealed meticulously.

*"But why would he hide it away from us?"*, **Wendy** asked raising her eyebrows in surprise. Her facial expression was a combination of snarl and doubt. Maybe she was doubting **She** speech partly because she didn't know her capabilities...

*"He wanted to make it a surprise to everyone..."*, **She** replied.

*"And how do you know, if I may ask?"*, **Wendy** said with a snort.

*"Never mind."*, **She** recoiled to herself. She then threw me a glare and muttered something to herself.

*"Have you regain your past memories?"*, She asked me with a smile on her face.

*"Yes ma'am"*, I answered. One of the values my breed always preserve is honesty. No matter what confronts us, we stay with the truth. This was the reason **She** was really pissed off when I indirectly called her a liar. We can even get very destructive when we are told a lie or tagged a liar.

*"Do you love me?"*, the question startled me. She must be very bold, or something was truly wrong with her. She was someone that was so strong-willed that she never gave into this animalistic feelings. The little time I have spent with her has made me understand some of what she is capable of, or maybe I thought I did. Why is she paying attention to her feelings now?

Truth being told, I love her. But, why am I so sure I loved someone that I have only known a few hours? It felt so real, but I am also used to suppressing such intimidating emotions. I am almost never publicly emotional, it takes more than an observation to trade my true inner emotions for publicity.

I looked at the searching eyes of my partners, the two ladies' glaring eyes were solid ice, but burning with intense anxieties. The whole tunnel was very silent, and everyone has stopped in their track just to get a response that couldn't only be answered affirmatively or vice versa. I felt tormented, my mind brawled in a whisper. My inner self wanted to get up and flew from their gaze.

*"I love everyone..."*, I began to respond, but was interrupted by **She**.

*"...We know that, but could you describe your feelings for me to me?"*, she sounded stern. Her expression was more of excitement, worry, and concern.

*"Why are you concerned about this? You have lost focus on our mission..."*, I asked subconsciously, but with a stern, stoic facial expression.

*"Please answer my questions first sir."*, She interrupted. Her smile has disappeared, what was left was a shadow of pity, irritation, and disdain. She started moving again towards the end of the tunnel which was a few metres away from us. Her pace was unusually faster.

We all started moving again behind her. **Vanessa** nudged me when she met up with my pace, **Wendy** did the same. The six men moved past us and stopped a few metres in front of me. Suddenly, each pulled out a sword, turned around and menaced towards me. I was so confused at what was happening. I stole a glance at my back, I wondered if there was anything behind me that they were advancing towards.

I saw nothing. I looked with surprise at **Wendy**, but she wasn't by my side anymore. Same with **Vanessa**! They were already by **She**'s side. I couldn't figure out what was going wrong. The whole episode happened so fast that I was left no room to come up with a solution. I knew I needed to act fast, whatever the reason, these guys were not going to have it easy on me.

*What have I done?* I remembered **She**'s question again. I hadn't answered her question yet. *Was it the reason this was happening?* I started backtracking my steps since they were just a few feet from me.

*"**She**! Please help me!"*, I screamed with fear.

**She** paid no attention to my cry, she kept moving closer to the end of the tunnel, with **Wendy** and **Vanessa** by her sides. I wonder what she was doing. I realized that if I were to come out of this alive, I must fight back.

In the past, I usually don't fight until I find a very legal reason to do so. Here, they was just no reason for me to fight back. Not even the face of these six angry men was a legal reason to fight back, nor **She**'s rejection. I needed to find a legal reason to fight back. The only way I realized I could stay away from getting roasted was defending myself while I find a route of escape through the tunnel.

I stopped my backtracking algorithm and suddenly dashed towards them. The moment I was two feet away from them, they thrust their swords at me. I jumped into the air, with the aim of jumping over them and rushing to the door. The height of the tunnel was little compared to the acrobatic demonstration I was about to perform. I dashed my head into the roof and that sent me downright to the floor on my back and their swords went downright into me.

I screamed in pain, as six swords were cutting through me. I still didn't understand why my partners were so cross with me that they were bent on killing me. Blood was gushing out my bowels. My mouth tasted blood, lots of blood. I was becoming dizzy. Despite the fact that I was already in blood, my six friends were still slashing me with the edge of the swords. My hands were no longer a part of my body, the swords had separated them. My legs were almost shredded into meats.

I threw a look at **She**'s direction, and I saw her looking at me smiling wickedly. **Wendy** and **Vanessa** were by her sides grinning mischievously. Just then I noticed, **Vanessa** and **Wendy** had fangs instead of teeth. They had no eyes in their eyes socket. There was blood stains on their lips...

*This was all a trap!*

*"You can't be as smart as I am! I know that you trust others easily. How I wish you told me that you loved me, then I would have been able to control you as I have done your partners..."*, **She** laughed mischievously, her hissing smile boomed and echoed through the tunnel.
