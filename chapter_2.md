# Joblessness is a Job

**For the first time since I had acquintance with driving, I have never driven a vehicle in the manner "She" &mdash;that's her name, she told me &mdash;drove it...**

The speed and recklessness scared me...

I was panting heavily when we alighted **Jar**, while she was grinning mischeviously &mdash;It was hurting and detrimental the way she mocked me...maybe because she was all-knowing.

I said nothing. I just stared with a stoic expression on my face &mdash;I was trying hard to keep my thoughts hidden from this being. I feel that it is a faulty effort...faulty may not be the right word, but it best describes how futile it was trying to hide my thoughts from this creature.

*"Come with me!"*, she proclaimed. *"Are you scared? Where is the fearless 'you' that I found in your past?"*

*Wait a minute! Did she just mention my past? How did she know my past? Did she read it from somewhere, or just used my mind again?!!!*

*"Madam! I don't care who you are! How did you know about my past?!"*, I barked, visibly agitated.

*I can use your mind to view and understand your past...and it takes a millisecond! As you can see also, I can speak into your mind too!*

I was by her side at this point. I gripped her because I lost my balance from the shock. *God! Which creature is this? How did she manage to speak into my subconscious, my mind...**She** must be powerful, what abilities does she possess? I need to know more about her!*

She chuckled aloud and stopped to buy me time to regain my balance. When I had regained strength to stand on my feet, she continued walking, but held my right hand with her left hand.

I started imagining what thoughts would be going through her mind. I just couldn't fathom what she was thinking at the moment &mdash;**whom am I to begin with?**

*"How long will it take me to know your capabilities?"*, I asked. I was becoming relaxed around her, but still scared of her abilities.

*"As long as it will take you to visit the sun on a horse!"*, she answered sarcastically, with a fake smile on her glowing face.

*"But what is your name?"*, I asked. I have certainly asked the same in the vehicle, and felt like her response was a lie. I just made the mistake she warned me about &mdash;making her look like a liar.

She stopped abruptly and faced me. Her eyes roamed searchingly across my face. The speed of the scrutiny was scary. I was becoming uncomfortable with it. I wondered what she was looking for, something that certainly wasn't visible on the outside, I guess.

Her eyes finally stopped at my lips, then she smiled and took her eyes off my face and back to the path.

*"..."*, I tried asking her a question, but was surprised that I didn't utter the word. *What has she done to my vocal cords &mdash;to me? I have suddenly become dumb...just by mere facial scrutiny?*

Well, as far as I know, I still have a mind and could think &mdash;which means I can still communicate with her.

*"I warned you about tagging me a liar, and you just did, though not intentionally...which means I could best keep us safe from my wrath by making you silent for a while lad!"*, she spurted the words without emotion. Each word had weight that broke me to pieces.

*She could also amplify the weight of a word in one's mind?* I started wondering, thinking about these abilities is tearing me apart.

I started feeling stupid for accepting the job in the first place. I allowed a female to impose her presence on me because of some super powers! I began to think about my past, but realized I had no past, to the best of my knowledge.

*Where did she get the theory of **"past"** from?*

*"Any moment you did not spend in **Megagem** is apparently erased from your memory, as long as you are here."*, she responded.

*"How did you manage to fish out my past based on the stated theory?"*

*That's something for the dust! You just can't fathom it!* She responded into my mind. I wish she was doing that telepathically. Strangely, she is not.

I became desperate and determined to figure out who she is. She is belittling me, and that was not going well with me. I began to desire those powers, to express such amazing abilities that couldn't be fathomed, and to speak...

*"I promise you that I will find out who you are, no matter what it costs me"*, I spoke finally. My jaws dropped in amazement &mdash;higher degree of amazement than when I couldn't speak.

**She** wasn't surprised, or her expression and conduct didn't show she was. She just walked on. *Why is she so strange?*

*"I am very sorry for tricking your brain to believing that you couldn't speak. I would be so happy if you found out who I am, and where I came from...I don't know about that myself, and it worries me. I believe that my existence here is no coincidence though. There is a strong connection between us, because those that originated from here cannot leave here, but you have been to **Earth**. I have also realized that **Megagem** is a prison for special breeds of... em... creatures, I would say. This place makes them forget about their past outside this world. You are a prisoner, so is the man that was sunbathing (though he's a villian). You are also a pilgrim here. I need your help to find an entrance to the outside universe. We both need each other though. I still have my powers because I still remember my past, but you don't know your powers because you don't think you have a past."*, she spoke soberly and sweetly &mdash;the second time I got that impression from her since our first encounter.

*"Are you saying that I am not from **Megagem**?"*

*"That is exactly right!"*

*"Where am I from then?"*, I asked &mdash;my pupils became dilated.

*"That is for you to find out, I need to find mine also."*, she replied. Her expression tells she is worried, really worried. I began to feel for her, knowing the pain of not knowing your home, stuck in a world that is a prison to pilgrims.

*"You have a big heart, my first compliment right?"*, she cut me off from my thoughts.

*"Yeap!"*, I said without thinking.

*"You were supposed to be worried about yourself, you are bothered about me."*

*"I don't understand what this is all about... but I believe you and you know that. I am just confused about the series of happenings within the last 12 hours."*

*"I know... this has caused a change in your plan. I feel bad that I approached you this way, but that is the only way you would have taken heed. You can be very stubborn at times based on your past."*

*"Stop defining me based on my past. I can change."*, I insisted vehemently.

*"Your past defines your present until you use the present to create a different past for yourself. I can also sense behaviours too."*

At this point, we had gotten to the mouth of a cave. I was surprised that such a magnificent cave still existed. It was not tall, if you assume it is. There is hardly any characteristic that defines it is a cave, save the rocky walls and absence of a door. It was perfectly carved by nature. I would have loved to describe it, but I was so preoccupied that I failed to pay attention to any details.
