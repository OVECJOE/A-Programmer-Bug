# Déjà vu Or Not Déjà vu

Lights flashed. The room flickered. The world spun. For a moment, I was lost in time and space. For a moment, I was gone. I was gone, and then I was back. What happened? I was in a room and someone was walking around, seemingly doing something.

My vision was blurry. I seemed to be returning from a long trip to unconsciousness. I blinked a few times, and the world started to come back into focus. Now, I noticed that I was lying on a bed. The bed was in a room. The room was tiny. The white walls stained with age and neglect. The only source of light was a flickering fluorescent tube on the god-forsaken ceiling. The room was freezing cold. I could see my breath. I shivered. Now the figure that was walking around came into focus. I could see the backside... It appeared to be a young lady. She was wearing a green waxed jacket, and her long brown hair was tied in a ponytail. She didn't seem to notice that I was awake. She was busy doing something. I tried to speak, but my throat was dry. I cleared my throat and tried again.

"Hello?" I said. My voice was hoarse and barely audible. The figure stopped moving. She turned around and looked at me. Her eyes were a deep shade of blue. She looked at me for a moment, and then she smiled.

She hurried to my side. "You're awake," she said. "How are you feeling?"

When she drew closer, I could see her face more clearly. She was young, maybe in her late twenties. She had a kind face that was marked by a scar that ran from her left eyebrow to her cheek. She was beautiful. I tried to speak, but my throat was still dry. She noticed and hurried to a small table in the corner of the room. She poured some water into a glass and brought it to me. "Here," she said. "Drink this."

I took the glass and drank. The water was cold and refreshing. I drank it all and handed the glass back to her. "Thank you," I said. "I feel like I've been hit by a truck."

"Who are you?" I asked. "And where am I?"

Her face fell. "You don't remember, do you?" she said. "You don't remember anything?" I shook my head. "I'm sorry," she said. "I hoped so hard that pain wouldn't take your memory away."

As I looked at her, with her soft eyes and her kind smile, I felt a strange sense of déjà vu. It was as if I had seen her before. It was as if I had known her before. But that was impossible. I had never seen her before. I had never known her before. Or had I?

Then I saw it. A flash of memory. A glimpse of something that I couldn't quite grasp. It was there for a moment, and then it was gone. I tried to hold on to it, but it slipped through my fingers like dust in the wind. I shook my head. "I'm sorry," I said. "I don't remember anything."

"I am Carol Halmen," she said. "I am your personal assistant while we were on Earth." She paused for a moment, as if she was waiting for me to say something. When I didn't, she continued. "Do you remember your name?"

I thought for a moment. "No," I said. "I don't remember my name."

She was disappointed and her face advertised lines of worry that reflected her concern. "This is going to be a problem," she said. "A big problem."

"This hideout is not safe anymore," she continued. "I have been breached. We need to move. Like now!"

I tried to sit up, but my body was weak. I fell back onto the bed. "What's going on?" I asked. "Who are you? And why do I feel like I know you?"

She looked at me for a moment, and then she sighed. "I am your personal assistant," she said. "I have been with you for a long time. I have been with you since the beginning."

Another flash of memory. Another glimpse of something that I couldn't quite grasp. Then a name. A name that seemed to come from nowhere. A name that seemed to come from everywhere. "Who is She?" I asked.

Carol looked at me, a smile kicked in. "You remember her, right?" she said. There was a glimpse of hope in her eyes. "You remember her, don't you?"

"I don't know," I said. "The name just came to me. I don't know who she is." Her face fell again.

"Her full name is Sheena," she said. "Sheena Riderin... She has betrayed you twice. She was the tool behind the downfall of our team. Our mission and vision were compromised because of her. She is the reason why we are here. She is the reason why you are here."

I tried to remember, but my mind was blank. "I don't remember her," I said. "I don't remember anything."

"She is sweet and kind," Carol said. "But she is dangerous, because she has lost her identity. The enemy is manipulating her using some sort of mind control. She kinda has two personalities. One is the sweet and kind Sheena, and the other is the dangerous and manipulative Sheena. Given her powers, she is one of our enemy's most deadly weapons." She paused for a moment. Tears welled up in her eyes. "All our friends are dead because of her."

The alarm went off. It was a loud, piercing sound that made my head hurt. Carol looked around, panic in her eyes. "We need to move," she said. "Now!"
